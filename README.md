## Datasets 
### ImageNet_to_AWN.csv: 
Each ImageNet synset is presented in a row. The Arabic matches found directly and using hypernyms are in the columns. I used "0" for direct and "[]" for hypernyms when Arabic matches were not found 

### ImageNet_to_AWN_with_hypernyms_IDs.csv:
The same results but with the WordNet IDs for hypernyms. Cells with "0" indicate that an Arabic match was not available  

## Downloading the images: 
You can download the images from the official  [ImageNet website](http://image-net.org/download)
